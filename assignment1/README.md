My first go at understanding p5 at all. Using the rotate function to get shapes in position was one of the dumbest things I could have done as it took so much trial and error to guess where it would end up postion wise since the center of rotation was not the center of the shape and I ended up doing this for every shape. I will say that it was interesting to group all similar shapes together so that I would place those all at once which prevented me from having to redo the rotation over and over again.
