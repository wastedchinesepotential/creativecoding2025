# Assignmet 3 Ideas


## Idea 1

*I originally wanted to make an Eye that had the pupil rotate based on minutes, the iris based on hours and the little sparkle/reflection ball in our eyes based on seconds. The I would have each of the 3 elements change color based on rotation if I had time*

## However, upod messing around with the sketch.js file i have deviated from this idea. this is Idea 2

*I am thinking a large circle that grows in size based on the hour, then a smaller circle (either inside it or next to it) that grows based on minutes. Then a third circle that grows and shrinks in size, like a pulse, every second except its min diameter is the D of the minute circle and the max D is the diameter of the hour circle. I am also wondering if I want to have them move in the shape of the infinity symbol while this is happening. I don't have the clock elements in yet but you can sort of see what I am imagining in the sketch.js file in this folder. Still very barebones I know but I will get there.* oh and RGB change of course.
