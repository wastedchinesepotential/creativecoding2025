# Week 2 Notes

## Relearning Fundamentals

*It has actually been longer than I remember since I have touched raw code like this, let alone in a different language. So doing this was very good for me brain. I seem to have lost some of the smoothness in the process but getting to make a messy page of code like it was my first time doing it again was much needed.
I didn't do anything crazy just messed around with different colors, strokes and manipulated shapes. Left a whole lot of notes but not really even for me to read later but for me to learn the UI and get that muscle memory in. Will be trying to keep it clean moving forward with declaring variables and using expressions etc. Starting to think about ways to create feedback loops of sorts in here.*
