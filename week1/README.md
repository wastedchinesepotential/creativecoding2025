# Week 1 Reading Responses

> “I want us all to be mechanics because none of us should be shut out from the workings of technology and capital; instead we should all be empowered to get under the hood and tinker with the machines, as well as take apart and (re)build the machines for our own purposes.”

-Jathan Sadowski, p. 36

*This is a meaningful quote to me because I think it speaks on the democratization of resources. In providing an open source mentality we allow the entire world to grow but in different ways. I think this will always drive innovation way more than a closed approach would. When it comes to programming I think this is the only way forward, we would be in the dark ages if we were not able to share and build new things on platforms like Github.*

>　"AI can be more creative, especially if you’re a person who’s not that creative to begin with... In other words, AI can be a great equalizer in promoting equity and inclusion: why should only the educated, hardworking, gifted, or talented be able to produce such things—why not also you?"

-Patrick Lin

*I don't actually agree with this but I am drawn to it becaaue of the hypocrisy it made me notice within me. As a heavy music producer in my undergraduate years, discovering autotune was one of the most liberating expereinces of my creative career. Back then I thought, why should people born with the ability to sing better be the only ones to get to sing? But over time, I realized the most extravagant displays of autotune were not the times it was used to make someone sound better but when it is used in a manner that allows for a unique sound. T-Pain is a great example. So perhaps with AI it isn't that it should be able to makeup for your lack of creativity but allow you to dive deeper into your creativity and offer avenues to be different in your creativity. So in the case of our coding projects, I think AI is not supposed to be the foundational character of the work but maybe as a tool it can help us see lanes that we previously were unaware of but the direction, intent and purpose has to come from within.*

>"As a result, instead of optimizing our machines for humanity—or even the benefit of some particular group—we are optimizing humans for machinery. And that’s why the choices we make (or don’t make) right now really do matter as much or more than they did for our ancestors contending with language, text, and printing." 

-Douglas Rushkoff, p. 15

*This quote caught my attention because I have a had my quarrels with this growing up. It felt like at some point in time the technologies built to assist us or serve us became a cog that tried to use us for our dependency on it. We became the product and it seems like the only way, other than to cut yourself off from tech entirely, is to learn how these systems work so that you can build or use it rather than be used by it. What better way to learn how a system to designed to work other than to learn to design the system itself?*
